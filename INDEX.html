        </p>

        <h3>Etris:</h3>
        <p>
            Etris is one of the last bastions of resistance against the Authority and other oppressive forces in the world. Known for its resilience and strong governance, Etris stands as a symbol of freedom and defiance, though it faces significant internal and external threats.
        </p>
        <h4>Important Figures:</h4>
        <h5>Lord Regent:</h5>
        <p>
            A pivotal figure in Etris, the Lord Regent is revealed to be the Fourth Prophet of the Ministry. His secret goal is to orchestrate the drowning of Etris as a sacrifice to the Drowned Gods, deities associated with the Depths who control various attunements. This dark plan is intended to fulfill the Prophets' larger, more sinister objectives.
        </p>
        <h5>Maestro Evengarde:</h5>

        </p>
        <h4>Lore:</h4>
        <p>
            Etris is a bastion of hope and resistance, but it is not without its challenges. The Lord Regent’s hidden allegiance to the Ministry and his dark plans to sacrifice the kingdom pose a significant threat. Meanwhile, Maestro Evengarde, with his Tempest Eye power, stands as a key figure in Etris’s defense, though his capabilities also underscore the high-stakes nature of the political and mystical conflicts within the nation.

        </p>
        <h5>Drallis Ehr:</h5>
        <p>
            Once the leader of the Authority, Drallis Ehr is renowned for surviving the catastrophic "God Storm," a feat that cemented his reputation as a powerful leader. His influence has waned as the Authority’s ambitions grow more reckless.
        </p>
        <h5>Warden Jericho:</h5>
        <p>
            Known for his immense physical strength, Warden Jericho is suspected to be a Warmaster, though his exact role within the Authority remains unclear. His formidable presence makes him a significant figure within the faction.
        </p>
        <h4>Lore:</h4>
